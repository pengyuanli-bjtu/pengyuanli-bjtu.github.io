I am an Eng.D. student at the College of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University(BJTU). My supervised by Prof. Dongxia Chang in the Center of Digital Media Information Processing Lab (Mepro). I have published several papers in SCI/CCF conferences and journals, including ACM MM, TMM, and Neurocomputing. (Resume: EN/中文)

My research interests include multi-view/multi-modal representation learning, deep clustering, self-supervised learning, and contrastive learning. In particular, I focus on:

*   🔍 **Contrastive Multi-view Clustering**

*   🧠 **Incremental Multi-view/Multi-Modal Representation Learning**

*   🌐 **Self-supervised Multi-view/Multi-Modal Representation Learning**

[AEMVC: Mitigate Imbalanced Embedding Space in Multi-view Clustering](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3746027.3754697)

**Pengyuan Li**, Man Liu, Dongxia Chang\*, Yiming Wang, Zisen Kong, Yao Zhao

[Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3746027.3754697) | [Code](https://github.com/Lummer-Li/AEMVC)


*   We found that the embedding space learned using the encoder-decoder architecture cannot embrace the efficacy of different feature directions. Therefore, we propose a novel Activate-Then-Eliminate Strategy for Multi-View Clustering to adjust the contribution strength of different feature directions dynamically.

[Deep Multi-view Clustering with Intra-view Similarity and Cross-view Correlation Learning](#)

**Pengyuan Li**, Dongxia Chang\*, Yiming Wang, Man Liu, Zisen Kong, Linhua Kong, Yao Zhao

[Paper](#) | [Code](https://github.com/Lummer-Li/MISCC)


*   We present a novel deep learning framework that mitigates view bias through joint optimization of intra-view similarity and cross-view correlation. The proposed method enhances fine-grained structures within each view and adaptively balances diverse information across views, ultimately improving clustering performance.

[DCMVC: Dual Contrastive Multi-view Clustering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925231225005612)

**Pengyuan Li**, Dongxia Chang\*, Zisen Kong, Yiming Wang, Yao Zhao

[Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925231225005612) | [Code](https://github.com/Lummer-Li/DCMVC)


*   We propose a novel deep contrastive multi-view clustering method termed DCMVC. The dual contrastive mechanism can alleviate the constraints of a single positive sample on contrastive learning by incorporating category information to regularize the feature structure and fully explore the consistency of similar samples.

[Bipartite Contrastive Multi-view Clustering with Singular Value Modulation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925231225022003)

Teng Zhang, **Pengyuan Li**, Zisen Kong, Dongxia Chang\*, Yao Zhao

Paper | Code


*   We reformulate contrastive learning as a binary classification problem, avoiding the limitation in previous contrastive methods that heavily depend on naturally paired data. By capturing sample-level and category-level consistency relationships among multiple views, the learned representations are further refined.

[Local Geometry-Enhanced Anchor Learning for Multi-view Clustering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925231225026256)

Zisen Kong, Zhiqiang Fu, Dongxia Chang\*, Yiming Wang, **Pengyuan Li**, Yao Zhao

Paper | Code


*   We introduce a coarse-grained anchor learning mechanism that maps each view anchor to the consensus space, effectively improving the expressiveness and learning of the framework.
